## Round 2

Experiment 1: Three pillars to Blockchain

### 1. Story Outline:

<div align="justify"> The students lands into the simulator and it demonstrates the following scenario. The simulator loads with text and illustration of Blockchain and then it moves on to Open Ledger and then to Distributed Ledger.

### 2. Story:
<div align="justify">The experitment demonstrates three pillars of Blockchain namely Decentralization,Transparency and Immutability. The creation of Blockchain is depicted by showing transactions in Open Ledger component. The concepts of Distributed Ledger is dipicted in the second phase where it illustrates how a valid transactions is ditributed among all users.

#### 2.1 Set the Visual Stage Description:
<h2>Construction of the set-up:</h2>
<div align = "justify">For better visualization,a simulator is provided. There is a need of physical significance for teaching Blockchain. Since, performing this experiment in real life is not feasible because of privacy issues,a simulator can always be the best alternative. A proper animated environment is given for better understanding of procedure. Three pillars of Blockchain namely(Decentralized,Transparency and Immutability) are performed one by one for deeper understanding of the concept. 
 
#### 2.2 Set User Objectives & Goals:
Sr. No |	Learning Objective	| Cognitive Level | Action Verb
:--|:--|:--|:-:
1.| User will be able to: <br>Understand the concept of blockchain  <br> and how it is applied. | Understand | Describe
2.| User will be able to: <br>Understand what is a open ledger<br>and it's creation | Understand| Describe
3.| User will be able to: <br>Apply the concept of open ledger<br>to create  an open ledger | Apply | Experiment with Apply
4.| User will be able to: <br>To analyze how mining works in validating <br> an unchecked transaction by  hashing | Analyze| Examine

Enhance conceptual and logical skill
</b>

#### 2.3 Set the Pathway Activities:

The simulator tab would allow:<br> <br>
<dd>1.	To make transaction from users that will create unvalidated blocks.<br>
2.	The block will further get linked showing the 'chain' of blockchain.<br>
3.	There would be a ‘Start’ button which will start the processes in first and last part.<br>
4.	Student can also read the instructions on the side for further explanation of what is happening.<br>
5.	Second part is for analyzing distributed ledger.<br>
6.  Third part is showing us how mining works and the process of validation of transaction.

##### 2.4 Set Challenges and Questions/Complexity/Variations in Questions:

Assessment Questions:<br>
Task 1: Understanding the open Ledger<br>

<dd><b> Which of these statements are true for open ledger:-<br>
a)	Every one has copy of ledger.<br>
b)	Ledger can be viewed by anyone.<br>
c)	Ledger is mutable.<br>
d)	None Of these<br></dd><br></b>
Task 2 : To understand how ledger is distributed among all members to prevent mutability<br><br>
<dd><b>1.Which of the following  is true for distributed ledger.<br>
a)	Everyone has a copy of ledger
<br>
b)	THere is one copy of the ledger
<br>
c)	Ledger is mutable.
<br>
d)	None of these
<br><br></b>
</dd>

Task 3 : To analyze the mining process<br><br>
<dd>
<b> A miner has completed the minning what will be the next step:-<br>
a)	Wait for second miner to complete<br>
b)	Wait for all members to complete<br>
c)	Validate the transaction and add it to the ledger<br>
d)	None of the above <br></b>
</dd>
