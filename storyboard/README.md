## Round 2

Experiment 1: Three pillars of Blockchain

### 1. Story Outline:

<div align="justify"> The students lands into the simulator and it demonstrates the following scenario. The simulator loads with text and illustration of Blockchain and then it moves on to Open Ledger and then to Distributed Ledger.

### 2. Story:
<div align="justify">The experiment demonstrates three pillars of Blockchain namely Decentralization, Transparency and Immutability. The creation of Blockchain is depicted by showing transactions in the Open Ledger component. The concepts of Distributed Ledger are depicted in the second phase where it illustrates how a valid transaction is distributed among all users.

#### 2.1 Set the Visual Stage Description:
<h2>Construction of the set-up:</h2>
<div align = "justify">For better visualization, a simulator is provided. There is a need of physical significance for teaching Blockchain. Since, performing this experiment in real life is not feasible because of privacy issues, a simulator can always be the best alternative. A proper animated environment is given for better understanding of the procedure. Three pillars of Blockchain namely (Decentralized, Transparency and Immutability) are performed one by one for deeper understanding of the concept.
 
#### 2.2 Set User Objectives & Goals:
Sr. No |	Learning Objective	| Cognitive Level
:--|:--|:--|:-:
1.| User will be able to: <br>Understand the concept of blockchain  <br> and how it is applied.
2.| User will be able to: <br>Understand what is a open ledger<br>and it's creation.
3.| User will be able to: <br>Apply the three pillars of blockchain  <br> and how it works.
4.| User will be able to: <br>Apply the concept of open ledger<br>to create  an open ledger.

#### 2.3 Set the Pathway Activities:

The simulator tab would allow:<br> <br>
<dd>1.	To develop transaction from users that will create validated blocks.<br>
2.	The block will further get linked showing the 'chain' of blockchain.<br>
3.	User can also read the instructions on the side for further explanation of what is happening.<br>
4.	Second part is for analyzing Open Ledger.<br>
5.  Third part is for analyzing the Distributed Ledger.
</dd>


##### 2.4 Set Challenges and Questions/Complexity/Variations in Questions:

Assessment Questions:<br>
Task 1: Understanding the three pillars of Blockchain.<br>

How are the three concepts(Decentralized,Transparency and Immutability) implemented in Blockchain?<br>

Task 2 : To understand the Open Ledger.<br>

How is a block recognized in Blockchain?<br>

Task 3 : To understand Distributed Ledger.<br>

How is a validated transaction distributed among all users?<br>

#### 2.5 Allow Pitfalls:
1. Ideally 

##### 2.6 Conclusion:
<dd>In this experiment, the user has learned about the three pillars of Blockchain namely Decentralization,Transparency and Immutability. The user is able to understand the concept of Blockchain and how it is applied. Also he/she is able to understand its creation. Apart from that, he/she is be able to apply the concept of open ledger & to create an open ledger. In addition to that, he/she is able to understand how transaction are distributed among all users throught Distributed Ledger.
</dd>

#### 2.6.1 Assesment:

It takes approx 8  minutes for an untrained user to completly understand and analyse the simulator.
And about 5 minutes for a trained user to completly understand and analyse the simulator.
</dd>
