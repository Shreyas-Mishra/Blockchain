#### 3. Instructional Strategy
###### Name of Instructional Strategy  :     <u> Expository and Guided enquiry.</u>
###### Assessment Method: <u>Formative Assessment.</u>

<u> <b>Description: </b> In this experiment you will learn about Block Chain: </u>
<br>
 <div align="justify">•	The main objective to consider this expository approach is that it is an interactive source of learning for the people/user.
<br>
•	The user will able to understand a relation between user and blocks.<br>
•	User can understand the basics of cryptographic sciences which cannot be understood by self-evaluation.<br>
•   Students will be able to learn about Blockchain concepts.<br>
•   Students will be able to learn about open ledger.<br>
•   Students will be able to learn about distributed ledger.<br>
•   Students will be able to learn about mining process.<br>

#### 4. Task & Assessment Questions:

Read the theory and comprehend the concepts related to the experiment.
<br>

Sr. No |	Learning Objective	| Task to be performed by <br> the student  in the simulator | Assessment Questions as per LO & Task
:--|:--|:--|:-:
1.| Users will be able to recall the concepts of Blockchain. | Describe number of block created in open ledger. | <div align="justify"> Which of these statements are true for Block Chain mechanism?<br> i. For Block Chain only.<br> ii. For Hashing only.<br> iii. For both<br> iv. None of these
2.| Users will be able to understand Blockchain i.e how block is recieved and transferred. | i.Describe genesis block. | <div align="justify">How genesis block can be created?<br> ii.How can transactions be added?
3.| Users will be able to apply the basics of Blockchain. | describe the process of hashing distributed ledger and mining. |<div align="justify"><br> i. Which block will be null in all transactions?.<br> ii. Which block will be mined first?<br> iii. For both<br> iv. None of these
4.| Users will be able to mine and how data is transferred in Blockchain. | Analyze the process of decryption in mining.. |<div align="justify"><br> i. Which block will have previous hash as null?.<br> ii. Examine which blocks are validated?

What Students will do? |	What Simulator will do?	| Purpose of the task
:--|:--|:-:
Examine the simulator screen and take note of all the instructions. | Display all the simulator contents.  |<div align = "justify">  Display simulator interface.
Click on start experiment button |<div align = "justify"> Transaction button will appear|<div align = "justify"> Mining will start |<div align = "justify"> To show how transaction are being processed by different miners
Click on the transaction button |<div align = "justify"> Transaction will come to the miner A , miner B and miner C. |<div align = "justify"> To show how transaction are being processed by different miners.
  |<div align = "justify"> Watch clock and miner consequently. |<div align = "justify"> It will show what time miner take to find correct hash. |<div align = "justify"> To show how much minimum time a miner will take to find a correct hash.
 |<div align = "justify"> Watch the miners. |<div align = "justify"> How transaction is confirmed. |<div align = "justify">To show how  the transaction completes.
