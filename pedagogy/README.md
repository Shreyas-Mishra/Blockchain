#### 1.1 Focus Area : Reinforce theoretical concept and Experimentation
#### 1.2 About the Experiment
<br/>
Illustrating the concept of blockchain.In this experiment the user understands the concept of Blockchain. The user also undderstands how mining is done. Initially we have theory portion which helps user understand Block chain and then a graphical representation through simulator which helps user enhance their concepts.

#### 1.3 Learning Objectives and Cognitive Level


Sr. No |    Learning Objective  | Cognitive Level | Action Verb
:--|:--|:--|:-:
1.| User will be able to: <br>Recall the cencepts of Block Chain <br> | Remember | Recall
2.| User will be able to: <br>understand Block Chain<br> i.e. how a block is recieved and transferred  | Understand| Describe
3.| User will be able to: <br>apply Blockchain in open ledger.. | Apply | Identity
3.| User will be able to: <br>Apply ditributive ledger on the blocks formed.. | Apply | Experiment
4.| User will be able to: <br>Mine the blocks<br> and how data is transferred in Block Chain | Analyze| Examine

<h3> 2 Instructional Strategy</h3>
<h4> 2.1 Name of Instructional Strategy  : </h4>    <u> Expository and Guided enquiry.</u>
<h4> 2.2 Assessment Method:</h4> <u>Formative Assessment.</u>
<h4> 2.3 Description: </h4>
    In this experiment you will learn about Block Chain: 
<br>
 <div align="justify">• The main objective to consider this expository approach is that it is an interactive source of learning for the people/user. <br>
•   The user will able to understand a relation between user and blocks.<br>
•   User can understand the basics of cryptographic sciences which cannot be understood by self-evaluation.<br>
•   Students will be able to learn about Blockchain concepts.<br>
•   Students will be able to learn about open ledger.<br>
•   Students will be able to learn about distributed ledger.<br>
•   Students will be able to learn about mining process.<br>

#### 3 Task & Assessment Questions:

Read the theory and comprehend the concepts related to the experiment.
<br>

Sr. No |    Learning Objective  | Task to be performed by <br> the student  in the simulator | Assessment Questions as per LO & Task
:--|:--|:--|:-:
1.| Users will be able to recall the concepts of Blockchain. | Describe number of block created in open ledger. | <div align="justify"> Which of these statements are true for Block Chain mechanism?<br> i. For Block Chain only.<br> ii. For Hashing only.<br> iii. For both<br> iv. None of these
2.| Users will be able to understand Blockchain i.e how block is recieved and transferred. | i.Describe genesis block. | <div align="justify">How genesis block can be created?<br> ii.How can transactions be added?
3.| Users will be able to apply the basics of Blockchain. | describe the process of hashing distributed ledger and mining. |<div align="justify"><br> i. Which block will be null in all transactions?.<br> ii. Which block will be mined first?<br> iii. For both<br> iv. None of these
4.| Users will be able to mine and how data is transferred in Blockchain. | Analyze the process of decryption in mining.. |<div align="justify"><br> i. Which block will have previous hash as null?.<br> ii. Examine which blocks are validated?

#### 4. Simulator Interactions 

<br>

Sr. No |	What students will do?	|  What simulator will do? | Purpose of the task
:--|:--|:--|:-:
1.| Students will examine the simulator screen and take notes of all the instructions. | Simulator will display the first page and will show illustration on left hand side and its description on right hand side. | <div align="justify"> Students will understand the concept of blockchain. <br> 
2.| Click on buttons like start, transaction (in a sequence). | Simulator will add the genesis block in 1st operation and will add a transaction in 2nd operation. | <div align="justify"> Students will be able to learn and analyse the functionality of blockchain. <br>
3.| Click on buttons like start, transcation (in sequence).  | Simulator will display the distributed ledger page and will perform the operation of validation. |<div align="justify"> Analyzing validation. <br>
4.| Student will click on transaction in mining section and observe the clock and miner consequently.  | Simulator will show what time miner takes to find the correct hash.  |<div align="justify"> How much time is taken by the miner to find the correct hash. <br>
5.| Student will interact with miners (A, B,...,N).  | Simulator will display how transaction is confirmed.  |<div align="justify"> To show how the transaction completes. <br>
